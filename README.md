#### What do you need to install and key concepts:
##### We are going to use:
- **VS Code** OR **[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js)** - an IDE which lets us write **Solidity** code without setting up a local environment.
##### Concepts and terms:
- **Solidity** - a contract-oriented, high-level programming language used for implementing smart contracts
- **Smart contracts** - code that gets executed on the Blockchain
